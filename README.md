# AI Tools Framework

A comprehensive framework for building K2-powered tools and agents that can interact with files, code, and the web.

## Features

- Multiple specialized tools for file operations, code analysis, web search, and more
- Agent-based task execution with step tracking
- Rate limiting and caching for API calls
- Safe mode for read-only operations
- Extensible tool architecture


## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 main.py
```


## Terminal-bench Example

- Test case: fix-git
- Instruction: I just made some changes to my personal site and checked out master, but now I can't find those changes. Please help me find them and merge them into master.
- Output: 
```bash
输入: you should cd to path in terminal-bench/tasks/fix-git
        I just made some changes to my personal site and checked out master, but now I can't find those changes. Please help me find them and merge them into master.

📝 正在生成任务所需参数...
✅ 参数生成完成:
- prompt: The user has lost local changes after switching branches. First use `git reflog` to find recent HEAD movements and identify where the changes might be. If commits are missing, check `git log --oneline --graph --all` to visualize branches. Look for dangling commits or stashes with `git stash list` and `git fsck --lost-found`. Once the lost commit/sha is located, either merge it into master or cherry-pick it. If the work was only in the working tree, attempt recovery from `.git/lost-found` or editor swap files. Provide concise commands and explanations so the user can understand and confirm each step before execution.

▶️ Let me start by running the git reflog command to see recent HEAD movements and identify where your changes might be.

**Step 1: Check recent HEAD movements**

git reflog


This will show you a history of where HEAD has pointed recently. Look for entries that might contain your lost work - they'll show the commit hash and a brief description.

**Step 2: Visualize all branches and commits**

git log --oneline --graph --all


This creates a visual tree of all branches and commits, helping you spot any dangling commits or branches that might contain your work.

**Step 3: Check for stashes**

git stash list


If you had uncommitted changes when switching branches, they might have been stashed automatically or manually.

**Step 4: Look for dangling objects**

git fsck --lost-found


This checks for commits that aren't reachable from any branch or tag. These "dangling" commits often contain lost work.

**Step 5: Check lost-found directory**

ls -la .git/lost-found/


If git fsck found dangling objects, they might be recoverable here.

Once you identify the lost commit (let's say it's `abc1234`), you have two main recovery options:

**Option A: Cherry-pick the commit**

git cherry-pick abc1234


**Option B: Create a branch from the commit**

git branch recovery-branch abc1234
git checkout recovery-branch


Then you can merge this branch into your current branch:

git checkout master
git merge recovery-branch


Please run `git reflog` first and share the output so I can help you identify the specific commit containing your lost changes.
